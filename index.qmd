I am a developmental evolutionary biologist interested in understanding how new anatomical structures originate and diversify in evolution.

I received my Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Yale University, where I was advised by [Dr. Gunter Wagner](https://eeb.yale.edu/people/faculty/gunter-wagner). In my doctoral research I studied the origin of a novel cell type in the placental mammal lineage — the decidual stromal cells of the uterus. We showed that their origin played a role in the evolution of embryo implantation, a key first step in the extended pregnancy of placental mammals.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Dr. Ruslan Medzhitov’s](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/ruslan-medzhitov/) lab in the Department of Immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine. My current work focuses on understanding the design principles of how tissues are organized and how they evolve. Specifically, I study the evolution of the gut and related organs that are developmentally as well as evolutionarily derived from the gut (such as the liver and the pancreas) in chordates.
